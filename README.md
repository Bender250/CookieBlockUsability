# CookieBlock Browser Extension

CookieBlock is a browser extension that automatically enforces your GDPR consent preferences for browser cookies. It classifies cookies on-the-fly into four distinct categories, and deletes those that the user did not consent to.

This helps enforce user privacy without having to rely on the website hosting the cookies.

## Description

__CookieBlock__ is an extension that allows the user to apply their cookie consent preferences to any website, no matter if the website has a cookie banner. The user specifies their consent options once when the extension is first installed, and then CookieBlock will try to remove any cookies that do not align with the user's policy as they are being created.

This is intended to ensure that the privacy of the user is preserved. One can reject any of the following categories:
* Functionality Cookies
* Analytical/Statistics Cookies
* Advertising/Tracking Cookies

Note that CookieBlock does not handle the cookie banner itself. In order to remove these annoying banners, we recommend using the Consent-O-Matic extension:

## Download Links

CookieBlock is compatible with both Firefox and Chromium-based browsers, and it is available on the following addon stores:
 * [Firefox Extension](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/cookieblock/)
 * [Chrome Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cookieblock/fbhiolckidkciamgcobkokpelckgnnol)
 * [Edge Extension](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/cookieblock/mnfolmjlccppcgdeinhidialajfiopcc)
 * [Opera Extension](https://addons.opera.com/en/extensions/details/cookieblock/)
 * Safari does not support cookie processing, so we cannot port CookieBlock to Safari. More info [here](https://github.com/dibollinger/CookieBlock/issues/4).

## Feedback

If you would like to submit feedback, or report websites that break because of the addon, you can open an issue on this Github page, or alternatively use [this Google Forms document](https://forms.gle/tL21ruvPZq2q218P8).


## Build Instructions

No requirements outside of what is contained in this repository is needed to build CookieBlock. Simply pack the contents of the subfolder `src` into a zip file, and you can install it into your browser. More information [here](https://extensionworkshop.com/documentation/develop/temporary-installation-in-firefox/).

Alternatively, you can also install __npm__ and use the [web-ext](https://github.com/mozilla/web-ext) command-line tool, with the command `web-ext build`.

### Reproducing the Model Files

The model files are constructed in the following process:
1. Run a webcrawler to collect browser cookies and categories from Consent Management Providers. The relevant code is found [here](https://github.com/dibollinger/CookieBlock-Consent-Crawler/tree/main/crawler).
2. Extract from the resulting database the training cookies, in JSON format. The script for this is found [here](https://github.com/dibollinger/CookieBlock-Consent-Crawler/tree/main/database_processing).
3. Use the [feature extractor in this repository](nodejs-feature-extractor/cli.js) to transform the cookies JSON into a sparse LibSVM matrix representation.
4. Provide this LibSVM with the associated class weights as input to the XGBoost classifier implementation (`xgb_train.py`) found in [this repository](https://github.com/dibollinger/CookieBlock-Consent-Classifier/tree/main/classifiers).
5. Execute a secondary Python script (`xgboost_small_dump.py`) to transform the XGBoost model into a minified JSON tree structure. This script produces the four model files `forest_class0.json` to `forest_class3.json`.
6. Copy these files into the folder:
```
./src/ext_data/model/
```
And replace the existing forest class files. Make sure to preserve their names as is.


## How It Works

The policy enforcement process is a background script that executes every time a cookie event is raised in the browser. If this event indicates that a cookie was added or updated, the extension will store the cookie in a local history
of cookie updates, and then perform a classification for that cookie.

The category for each cookie is predicted using a forest of decision trees model trained via the XGBoost classifier, and a set of feature extraction steps.
First, the cookie is turned into a numerical vector, which is then provided as an input to the forest of trees. This produces a score for each class, and the best score is the class that gets assigned to the cookie.

Available cookie categories are:
* __Strictly Necessary__
* __Functionality__
* __Analytics__
* __Advertising/Tracking__

Granularity is intentionally kept low to make the decision as simple as possible for the user. Note that "strictly necessary" cookies cannot be rejected, as this is the class of cookies that is required to make the website work. Without them, essential services such as logins would stop working.

The feature extractor can be found in the subfolder `nodejs-feature-extractor/`. This is used to extract the features for the training data set.

For the classifier training, see:

https://github.com/dibollinger/CookieBlock-Consent-Classifier


## Known Issues

The classifier is not completely accurate. It may occur that certain functions on some sites are broken because essential cookies get misclassified. This is hard to resolve without gathering more cookie data to train on. As such, the approach has its limits.

To resolve these problems, we maintain a list of known cookie categories. This is a JSON file storing cookie labels for known cookie identifiers. If a cookie is contained in this file. the prediction is skipped, and the known class is applied.

By reporting broken websites, you can help us keep an updated list of cookie exceptions. This makes the extension more useable for everyone while also keeping a high level of privacy.
