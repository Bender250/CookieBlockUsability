* Better message exchange between options and background script
* Revise unlimited storage permission. Currently needed for storage of cookie updates locally.
* Handle third-party cookies differently:
   1. get all current tab domains
   2. if cookie host does not match any of them, it's a third party cookie
   3. else it's a first party cookie
   -> May result in false negatives, but much rarer
   -> Problem: how to classify cookies already stored in the browser? Don't do it at all?
* Add a feedback box
* Add proper Bayes Decision
* Add timings for debugging
* Change the classifier so that cookie labels are remembered for a short duration, such that cookies aren't constantly reclassified.
* Need to verify feature extraction correctness.
* Improve performance of the extension.
* Localization
