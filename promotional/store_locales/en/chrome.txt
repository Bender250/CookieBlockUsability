CookieBlock is a browser extension designed to automatically remove cookies that compromise your privacy.

* **Automatic Cookie Classification**: CookieBlock automatically removes privacy-intrusive cookies that are used for analytics or advertising. It works everywhere in the world independently of language or law.

* **Complementary Tool**: CookieBlock does not remove or interact with cookie banners. For that, we recommend extensions [Consent-O-Matic](https://github.com/cavi-au/Consent-O-Matic), [I don’t care about cookies](https://www.i-dont-care-about-cookies.eu/), or [uBlock Origin](https://ublockorigin.com/) with Annoyances filters (e.g., EasyList Cookie). Using only them does not protect your privacy. Research showed that almost 70% of websites track users after dismissing the banner or prior consent [[1](https://karelkubicek.github.io/post/cookieblock), [2](https://ahmedbouhoula.github.io/post/automated), [3](https://doi.org/10.1109/SP40000.2020.00076)]. Hence we recommend using CookieBlock together with banner removal extensions.

* **Website breakage**: CookieBlock can sometimes break website functionality such as logins (our evaluation found that in 7% of websites). CookieBlock popup allows to 'Pause Cookie Removal' globally, or 'Add Domain Exception' for a given website to limit such disruptions.

Developed by the Information Security Group at ETH Zürich, as part of the USENIX Security publication "Analyzing Cookies Compliance with the GDPR."
